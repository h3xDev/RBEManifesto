RBE DEFINITION

The Resource-Based Economy (RBE) is a way of life based on efficient use of resources to generate abundance by means 
of technology and human empathy, where the scientific method and such are applied to social interest and well-being. 
Specifically, this proposal is also understood as a local and global system for managing resources in which the goods and 
services are available to all as the common inheritance of humanity as well as all the inhabitants of our planet, where there
is no need to use money, credit or financial systems, barter, or any other system of trade or commerce. The main premise of 
this proposed way of life is based on the understanding that the Planet Earth has sufficient but finite resources to cover the
necessities of life for all its inhabitants and therefore they can be managed to allow anyone to make use of them in a 
reasonable and equitable manner.   

Therefore, the RBE is opposed to the monetary system, because they see it as antiquated, obsolete, and limited, and consequently 
propose leaving it behind. The theorists and proponents of RBE make a critique of the monetary system 
(which includes Capitalism, Fascism, Communism, Socialism, and, in general, any other ideology that uses money)
pointing out that it only serves to manage and perpetuate scarcity and denies the abundance of resources the planet has to 
provide necessities to all human beings, generating many problems like inefficiency, unsustainability, classism, violence, 
among others that could be avoided if we tried to live in a different way.  
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

-General Characteristics of RBE-  

Moving beyond money: Goods and services are produced with gradual reduction in human intervention through automation and 
robotization. The distribution of goods and services would be fair and plentiful, taking demand into account and the need 
for the product and the ability to produce it. When people have what they need, money becomes irrelevant. 
In the same way no type of commerce or barter is needed, since the individual can get what they want when they need it, 
as long as it is available.  

Gradually moving beyond work: By applying computational technology to the management of human affairs and the processes of 
production, distribution, and recycling, they make human intervention unnecessary. The role of man as far as work is concerned
is to supervise and try to overcome the necessity of human work in areas not yet automated.  

Declaring the Earth's resources to be the common inheritance of all the inhabitants: Replacing private property with demand.
Upon eliminating scarcity and upon enabling plentiful production for all people through automating production, the very 
utility of private property disappears, and so do social stratification and structural poverty. Access is granted to goods 
and services in such a way that they are always available when they are needed. Products are valued by their use and not by
their ownership, therefore in the midst of plenty, managed intelligently and in an efficient manner, anyone would be able to
have access to them.   RBE recognizes that humanity belongs to a single species and therefore benefits all people equally, 
independent of the geographical location in which they are found, the culture and values they have been exposed to, 
or the physical characteristics they have.

Holistic and global system: Recognizes that the planet is a holistic system in which all parts influence and interact with 
each other.   According to this theory, concepts such as nation or country do not exist in the physical reality of the planet
and represent fictitious or hypothetical borders and, therefore, these imaginary separations are not taken into account in the
operation of the system.  

Cooperative Society: Competition is rivalry or opposition between those who aspire to the same achievement.
This theory sees competition as obsolete because, in a environment of abundance, no one has to struggle or engage in mutual
confrontation to acquire goods or services that could not be obtained otherwise due to scarcity.
Instead, the abundance gives everyone access to meet their needs.  

Emergent system: This theory introduces the concept of emergent society. It recognizes that the level of knowledge is never 
final, it never becomes stagnant or reaches a limit; it is a constant process of refinement. Therefore, the system is prepared
and designed to be modified and updated continuously. This would be the opposite of an established society, in which the system
rejects the new possibilities and technologies, product of new knowledge, in order to perpetuate itself.  

Gradual elimination of the state structure and the corporations as a method of social management: At this point and at the 
current state of technology, the state becomes irrelevant because, according to this theory, it's main function is to lock in
the profits of the small advantaged groups and maintain the status quo for them, the same reason it maintains the monetary 
system that benefits them, together with its inherent consequences, such as the generation and perpetuation of artificial 
scarcity. In its place, the scientific method is applied directly to the social system for human and environmental benefit.  

Maximum durability and quality in all products produced: Production of goods with the highest possible quality, completely 
eliminating planned obsolescence. In other words, everything should be designed to maximize durability and minimize ecological
impact, not so the product is broken in a certain amount of time just so the same product can be purchased again, allowing the
work/productivity consumption cycle to persist.  

Full use of renewable and clean energy: With the abundance of renewable and clean energy (solar, wind, tidal, geothermal, wave
and others), the use of fossil fuels (pollutant and non-renewable) is negligent.  

Use of universal hardware: Design of all components with standardized and easily-interchangeable connections to allow physical
product upgrades to increase their useful lifetimes.  

Everything must be designed to be recycled: If any product in any way breaks or becomes obsolete, it must have been designed to
be 100% recycled or as nearly so as possible.

-Specific characteristics of the Resource-Based Economy- 

Moving beyond the illusion of private property: This does NOT mean losing anything (like home privacy), but rather 
understanding that the oceans, the land and all of nature cannot have owners or proprietors, but managers and caretakers.
Private property is a primitive and inefficient idea that creates scarcity and inequality.
Its alternative is unconditional use or access demand to generate abundance.
Private property then ceases to be the false illusion where the individual owns animals and complete ecosystems, such as 
limited land and natural resources, and limits itself to the real meaning of what is private and what is understood by privacy,
ranging from personal belongings and necessities, to a minimal living space and the exclusive use of a place in which the
individual can perform activities that concern only him or his life as an individual in society.  

Moving beyond monotonous, dangerous and tedious work: The robotization and automation of production processes makes human 
intervention in mass production unnecessary. Man must be free to create and innovate and not be tied to assuming and 
repeating tasks or roles that a machine can do better and without risk. The obligation to work disappears since work itself
changes owing to the need for each individual to participate in a voluntary and active manner in the tasks that are required
to achieve general well-being and to optimize the technology as part of this process.  

Moving beyond institutions and their power: The state is irrelevant since its only function is to ensure the control of the 
status quo, the establishment and the elites.   Regarding the latter point on the state as well as multinational corporations,
various authors have reached the conclusion that these kinds of organization constitute the biggest mafias ever created and
accepted by the world population. Nevertheless, in an RBE the individual should enjoy the right of free association but not for
the purpose of taking advantage of or oppressing others but as part of the continuous process of optimization and improvement
where the power does not reside in mafias or organizations but in each individual who alone or with others acts freely and to
the benefit of all and therefore to his own benefit.  

Sustainable production: The products for consumption must be durable (without planned obsolescence), recyclable, standardized,
upgradeable and with minimum impact on the environment and the people. At the same time, they must be "Open Source" or open in
their composition and architecture so that anyone can know their parts and functionality, at the same time it is essential 
that anyone be able to modify and innovate them.   To achieve this, technology and knowledge in general, as far as possible
must be modular and scalable.   Finally, in order for a production process to be sustainable, it must be in touch with current
reality, the best practices for utilization, and full understanding of the environmental impact it will have on every 
ecosystem or location where one might try to create a production chain to satisfy the needs of the individual.
Sustainable production means that as the generations pass there will not be risk of scarcity because of waste or ecosystem 
exhaustion.  

Total development of the individual: All human beings will have equality of conditions from the moment they are born, 
and the system will be at the service of all to explore and develop their abilities and talents to the maximum or to the 
point that individual desires it, so the well-being of the human race as measured by the well-being of the individual and 
his/her environment is maximized in a RBE.

-Differences between the monetary system and the RBE: The pricing system or monetary economy - 

1.   Competition Vs. Creative Cooperation  
2.   Anti-economy: negligent management Vs. Economy: responsible management  
3.   Vertical society: rich and poor Vs. Horizontal society: universal access to necessities.  
4.   Cultural relativism: focus on and justification of differences derived from ethnocentric beliefs Vs. Unification: search for and justification of the causes and common interests of all humanity.  
5.   Employment, work: Technological unemployment, Exploitation, Lucrative profits only for selfish coorporations Vs. Automation: Reduce and eliminate work that is dangerous, boring and/or repetitive. Benefits for all, without exception. Creative spare time instead of obligatory labor.  
6.   Established society, stagnant Vs. Emergent society, dynamic.  
7    Absence of social design: selfish oligarchy.  Elitism. Vs. Integrated social design: preventive solutions.  
8.   Planned obsolescence impacts the products Vs. Optimal product design; top quality: lasting, recyclable and upgradeable.  
9.   Treating the symptoms or consequences of problems (impossible to solve) Vs. Treating the causes of problems (only way to solve).  
10.  Paradigm of terror: behavior based on the fear of punishment Vs. Respect Paradigm: responsible behavior based on appropriate and unbiased education.
